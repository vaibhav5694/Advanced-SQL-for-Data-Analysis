Database 

It is a systematic collection of data.

Why we need database:
To manage data effectively.
Manual validation of databse is very tough to do.
Flexibilty to manage the databse.
Multiple people can work on database at one time.
Also for more security.
Access control.

DBMS
Database management system.
It was implemented in 1960.


Introduction to SQL:

SQL is used to create,update,delete database.
Here data are stored in rows and columns form.

RDBMS:
It is based on relational model.
In RDMS each row is a record with a unique id called key.


There are some flavours of SQL:

MYSQL
ORACLE
MYSQL SERVER
SYBASE

SQL Query:

Select * FROM data where age > 20:



SQL is used as a DDL.
Used to define or create a database.

Also as a DML.
Used to maintain already existing database.

As DCL.
Used to protect your database against corrution and misuse.


SQL is also used a client server language.
SQL is also used 

SQL Tables:

Fields are basically columns in a table with specific information.
Record is basically an individual info.

Datatypes in SQL:

Int 
Char
Date 


Creatre Database:
CREATE DATABASE Database_Name

Using Database:
USE Database_Name

DROP Database 
DROP Database_Name

No Null Constraint:
Not null constraint ensures that a column cannot have a null value.

Default Constraint: 
Set a default value to a consteaint where no value is specified.

Unique Contraint:
Each value need to be unique.

Primary Key Constraint:
It uniquely identifies each records in a table.

Foreign Key:
It is a primary key in other table.

Creation of a table:

CREATE TABLE tablename

e_id NOT NULL
E_name VARCHAR(30)

INSERT INTO employee values(2 , 'Ram')

Select Statement:

SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE CONDITION

UPDATE:

UPDATE columnnane
SET column_name = 'Xam' age = 32
WHERE condition 



DELETE values:

DELETE FROM tablename
WHERE condition

ALTER Table:
Update , modify ,delete in existing table.

DROP and TRUNCATE:

DROP TABLE tablename
DROP will delete table from database.
TRUNCATE will delte containt from table.

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name
DROP TABLE talbe_name


Import csv file in SQL:

Normal Import

String function in SQL:
System defined function:
rand() ,  round() , count() etc.
String function: UPPER() , LOWER() , LENGTH() , SUBSTRING() , NOW() , FORMAT() , CONCAT() etc. 

Aggregate function : Mainly used by select and groupby.
COUNT() - Give total no. of rows , SUM() , AVG() , MAX() , MIN() etc.

Date & Time : 
Select extract(Month/year/date/dow from date_column) 


User-Defined function:


GROUP BY: This statement group rows that have the same rows in summary table.

E.g., 
SELECT mode , SUM(amount) AS Total
FROM payment
GROUP BY mode
HAVING count(amt) >=2 and count(amt) < 4
ORDER BY total desc

Group by usi ka kro jisme same chij repette kre naaki primary key otherwise it will give errorr.

HAVING : Used to apply filter on group by.

SELECT - WHERE
GROUP BY - HAVING


Timestamp: Datatype having date and time.

 TIME() , DATE() , YEAR() , TIMESTAMP() , TIMESTAMPZ() , TIMEZONE() , NOW() , TIMEOFDAY()
CURRENT_TIME() , CURRENT_DATE()

EXTRACT:
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM Date_field)

JOINS IN SQL:
Join mean to combine something. For join we need to have similar column in between two table.

INNER JOIN:
Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

 SELECT column_name FROM TableA inner join TableB
ON id.talbeA = id.tableB

Left: Common + Left
Right : Common + Right
Outer or Full : All
Inner : Common

SELF JOIN: Table joined with itself.


 SELECT column_name FROM Table as T1 join Table AS t2
ON t1.id = t2.id

UNION & UNION ALL : Copy paste two table. Same no. of columns , same data type , have them in the same order.
UNION remove duplicates record while UNION ALL not.


SUBQUERY in SQL: It is a nested query (Query inside query).

select * from payment
where amt > (select avg(amt) from payment )
Here we also use IN and EXISTS opearator.

Window Function:

It has:

1) Aggregate 
2) Analytical
3) Ranking
over particular window.


Aggregate: SUM , COUNT , MIN , MAX.
Ranking: ROW_NUMBER() , RANK , DENSE_RANK , PERCENT_RANK
Analytic: LEAD , LAG , FIRST_VALUE , LAST_VALUE


CASE Expression:
If there is no else then it will return null.

CASE 
WHEN condition1 THEN result1
WHEN condition2 THEN result2
ELSE other result
END
or
CASE amt
WHEN 500 THEN result1
WHEN 100 THEN result2
ELSE other result
END


CTE: Common table expression
It is use by adding WITH
WITH my_cte AS (SELECT a,b,c FROM Table1)
SELECT a,c FROM cte


last 30 day:

> current_date - interval 30 day.

datediff(month , HireDate , Getdate() )

going 2 month back from current date:
DATEADD(dd , 1 , EOMONTH(getDate() , -2)
)
